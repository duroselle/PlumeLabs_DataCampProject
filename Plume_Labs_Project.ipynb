    "## Predicting Street Level Air Pollution in French cities\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Air pollution is nowadays a major issue not only in countries such as China or India but also in developed countries. The World Health Organization estimate on the number of death due to poor air quality is close to 8 million (both indoor and outdoor) worldwide whereas the European Environmental Agency counted almost 450 000 premature deaths in Europe with the same cause. \n",
    "\n",
    "To monitor air quality, institutions and agencies are focusing on four main pollutants : \n",
    "- ozone (O3), \n",
    "- nitrogen dioxide (NO2),\n",
    "- particulate matter with diameter below 2.5 μm (PM2.5),\n",
    "- particulate matter with diameter below 10 μm (PM10).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although regulated by national and European standards, evaluation of one's real exposure to air pollution at the street level is still a challenge today. Air quality monitoring is performed with expensive reference instruments (ideally) disseminated at strategic locations within the cities. However, because of pollutants' heterogeneity in terms of sources, volatility and chemical reactivity, pollutant concentrations can vary widely between very close areas and thus, one's exposure can vary accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Plume Labs\n",
    "Plume Labs (http://www.plumelabs.com) is a French start-up which aims, through the use of open data, to provide to citizens information on their exposure to air pollution. This information is already available today for an increasing number of megalopolis through mobile applications, but the final goal of Plume Labs is to provide pollution levels at any point on the globe. To achieve this, physical models as well as artificial intelligence tools are used concurrently. \n",
    "\n",
    "We propose to predict the air quality level at the street level in several French cities. To reach this goal, we rely on an increasingly popular model in the atmospheric science community called **land use regression model (LURM)**. By using relevant parameters based on the land-use (e.g., the surface occupied by residential buildings within a given perimeter), as well as meteorological ones, matched with the monitoring station readings, it's possible to build a statistical model to predict air quality levels. Such models can then be used at other locations within the cities to construct a street-level air pollution map. Examples can be seen in the scientific literature :\n",

    "### Objectives\n",
    "The goal of the challenge is to predict three pollutants' (NO2, PM2_5, PM10) concentrations at the location of monitoring stations in several cities and at given time periods by focusing the training algorithms on :\n",
    "- the regular structure of the time series (strong daily and seasonal cycles)\n",
    "- the correlation between pollution and meteorology (temperature, precipitations,...)\n",
    "- the correlation with static factors (e.g., length of roads within a buffer of x meters, density of residential/industrial/... buildings, see below for a complete description of the dataset)"
